##
Objective: Investigate the impact of delays and cancellations on refund requests.

       Key Questions:
        - Is there a correlation between delay length and refund requests?
        - Which routes experience the most delays or cancellations, and what are the common causes?

**Insights:**

Across the entire network, there were a total of **4172** delays & cancellations out of the 31653 total journeys made (approx 13.2%)

Out of these, **1880 journeys were cancelled** (approx 5.9%), **2292 journeys were delayed** (approx 7.2%).

Out of the 4172 delayed and cancelled journeys, there were **1118 refund requests**. Approximately 26.8% of all delayed/cancelled journeys resulted in refund requests. 

The average delay length for delayed journeys across the entire network was **40.67 minutes**.

In general, there is not a strong correlation between delay length an number of refund requests.

From the plot of delay lengths for each route that experienced delays, we can see the
