# MySQL-Power-BI-Data-Driven-Insights-Portfolio
This repository showcases my data analysis skills through a series of objectives utilizing MySQL and Power BI. The project employs a mock dataset of UK rail ticket sales from January to April 2024, offering insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills in data analysis using MySQL for querying and Power BI for data visualization. The project is based on a mock dataset of UK rail ticket sales from January to April 2024, which I analyzed to extract meaningful insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

The project is organized around a series of objectives that demonstrate my ability to:

- Write efficient SQL queries to extract and transform data.
- Create interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.
- Use data-driven insights to solve real-world business problems.

This project is part of my data analysis portfolio and is intended to highlight my proficiency in working with databases, conducting analyses, and presenting insights in an accessible format.

Feel free to explore the SQL queries, Power BI dashboards, and reports to see how I approach different analytical tasks, solve business questions and tell a story using data.

## Objectives

1. Journey Duration Analysis: Identify routes with the longest and shortest journey times and evaluate consistency with advertised times.

   Questions:
      - Which routes have the longest and shortest average journey times?
      - Are there routes where travel time consistently exceeds the advertised times?
   
2. Peak Travel Time Analysis: Understand travel patterns to identify peak and off-peak times.

    Questions:
      - What are the busiest travel times and days of the week by passenger volume?
   
3. Route Popularity and Revenue Analysis: Analyse passenger volume and revenue generation across routes.

   Questions:
      - What are the most and least popular routes by passenger volume?
      - Which routes generate the most and least revenue?
      - Which routes have the highest average ticket price?
      - Which routes have the highest number of first-class ticket sales?
4. Customer Segment Analysis: Explore Relationship between Ticket Type, Revenue and Average Ticket Price.

   Questions:
      - Do Railcards account for more revenue?
      - Which ticket type contributes the most to total revenue?
      - What is the average ticket price for each ticket type?
      - How does revenue from railcard tickets compare to non-railcard tickets?
      - Does the average ticket price vary significantly by ticket type?


5. Ticket Price and Journey Characteristic Analysis: Exploring the relationship between journey length, speed, and ticket pricing.

   Questions:
      - Do faster routes tend to have higher ticket prices?
      - Are there routes with unusually high or low prices compared to the average?

6. Refunds and Delays Analysis: Investigate the impact of delays on refund requests and trends.

   Questions:
      - Is there a correlation between length of delays and amount of refund requests?
      - Which routes experience the most delays or cancellations, and what are the common reasons?


## Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI

## Project Structure
- `SQL_Queries/`: SQL queries for each objective.
- `PowerBI_Dashboards/`: Power BI `.pbix` files.
- `Visualizations/`: PNG files of key visualizations.
- `Report/`: Detailed analysis and conclusions for each objective.

## How to Explore
You can find the SQL queries in the `SQL_Queries/` folder and download the `.pbix` files from `PowerBI_Dashboards/` if you'd like to explore the dashboards interactively. Summarized visuals can be found in `Visualizations/`, and detailed explanations are provided in the `Report/` folder.
