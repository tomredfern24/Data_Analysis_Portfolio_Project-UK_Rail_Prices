MySQL & Power BI: Data-Driven Insights Portfolio

This repository highlights my data analysis skills through a series of analytical objectives using MySQL and Power BI. The project uses a mock dataset of UK rail ticket sales from January to April 2024, offering insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue generation. Dataset source: ‚ÄòUK Train Rides‚Äô from mavenanalytics.io data playground.

üìò Introduction

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This project demonstrates my proficiency in data querying, transformation, and visualization using MySQL for database analysis and Power BI for data-driven insights. The mock dataset of UK rail ticket sales provides a real-world scenario where I analyse sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

Key objectives of this project include:

   - Writing efficient SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyse data.
   - Developing interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize critical metrics and trends.
   - Applying data-driven insights to address business challenges, such as identifying peak travel times, analysing customer segments, and evaluating route performance.

Explore the SQL queries, Power BI dashboards, and reports to understand my approach to solving business questions and storytelling through data.

üéØ Objectives
1. Journey Duration Analysis

   Objective: Identify routes with the longest and shortest average journey times and assess their consistency with advertised times.

       Key Questions:
        - Which routes have the longest and shortest average journey times?
        - Are there routes where travel times consistently exceed advertised durations?

2. Peak Travel Time Analysis

   Objective: Analyse hourly and daily travel patterns to identify peak and off-peak periods.

       Key Questions:
        - What are the busiest travel times and days of the week by passenger volume?
        - What proportion of journeys occur on weekdays vs. weekends?

3. Route Popularity and Revenue Analysis

   Objective: Evaluate passenger volume and revenue generation across different routes.

       Key Questions:
        - Which routes are the most and least popular?
        - Which routes generate the highest and lowest revenue?
        - Which routes have the highest average ticket prices and most first-class ticket sales?

4. Customer Segment Analysis

   Objective: Explore the relationship between ticket type, railcard usage, and revenue contribution.

       Key Questions:
        - Do railcards account for higher revenue?
        - Which ticket types contribute the most to total revenue?
        - How does the average ticket price differ by ticket type?
        - What is the comparison between railcard and non-railcard revenue?

5. Ticket Price and Journey Characteristic Analysis

   Objective: Understand the relationship between journey length, speed, and ticket pricing.

       Key Questions:
        - Do faster routes have higher ticket prices?
        - Are there routes with unusually high or low prices compared to the average?

6. Refunds and Delays Analysis

   Objective: Investigate the impact of delays and cancellations on refund requests.

       Key Questions:
        - Is there a correlation between delay length and refund requests?
        - Which routes experience the most delays or cancellations, and what are the common causes?
