MySQL & Power BI: Data Analysis Portfolio Project

This repository highlights my data analysis skills through a series of analytical objectives using MySQL and Power BI. The project uses a mock dataset of UK rail ticket sales from January to April 2024, offering insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue generation. Dataset source: ‚ÄòUK Train Rides‚Äô from mavenanalytics.io data playground.

üìò Introduction

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This project demonstrates my proficiency in data querying, transformation, and visualization using MySQL for database analysis and Power BI for data-driven insights. The mock dataset of UK rail ticket sales provides a real-world scenario where I analyse sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

Key objectives of this project include:

   - Writing efficient SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyse data.
   - Developing interactive Power BI dashboards to visualise critical metrics and trends.
   - Writing DAX measures within Power BI to clearly demonstrate key data, and allow for interactive data visualisation.
   - Applying data-driven insights to address business challenges, such as identifying peak travel times, analysing customer segments, and evaluating route performance.

Explore the SQL queries, Power BI dashboards, and reports to understand my approach to solving business questions and storytelling through data.

üéØ Objectives
1. [Journey Duration Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/1.%20Journey%20Duration%20Analysis.md)

   Objective: Identify routes with the longest and shortest average journey times and assess their consistency with advertised times.
   
   Key Questions:
           
      - Which routes have the longest and shortest average journey times?
      - Are there routes where travel times consistently exceed advertised durations?

2. [Peak Time Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/2.%20Peak%20Time%20Analysis.md)

   Objective: Analyse hourly and daily travel patterns to identify peak and off-peak periods.
   
   Key Questions:
   
      - What are the busiest travel times and days of the week by passenger volume?
      - What proportion of journeys occur on weekdays vs. weekends?

3. [Route Popularity and Revenue Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/3.%20Route%20Popularity%20and%20Revenue%20Analysis.md)
   
   Objective: Evaluate passenger volume and revenue generation across different routes.
   
   Key Questions:
           
      - Which routes are the most and least popular?
      - Which routes generate the highest and lowest revenue?
      - Which routes have the highest average ticket prices and most first-class ticket sales?

4. [Customer Segment Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/4.%20Customer%20Segment%20Analysis.md)

   Objective: Explore the relationship between ticket type, railcard usage, and revenue contribution.
   
   Key Questions:
           
      - Do railcards account for higher revenue?
      - Which ticket types contribute the most to total revenue?
      - How does the average ticket price differ by ticket type?
      - What is the comparison between railcard and non-railcard revenue?

5. [Ticket Price and Journey Characteristics](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/5.%20Ticket%20Price%20and%20Journey%20Characteristics%20Analysis.md)

   Objective: Understand the relationship between journey length, speed, and ticket pricing.
   
   Key Questions:
           
      - Do faster routes have higher ticket prices?
      - Are there routes with unusually high or low prices compared to the average?

6. [Refunds and Delays Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/6.%20Refunds%20and%20Delays%20Analysis.md)

   Objective: Investigate the impact of delays and cancellations on refund requests.
   
   Key Questions:
      
      - Is there a correlation between delay length and refund requests?
      - Which routes experience the most delays or cancellations, and what are the common causes?

üìà High Level Insights

   - [Journey Duration Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/1.%20Journey%20Duration%20Analysis.md): Around 28% of routes experience delays, with notable issues on routes like Manchester Piccadilly to Leeds. Operational inefficiencies or external factors could be causing these delays. Further analysis is needed to address potential causes, improving punctuality.

   - [Peak Time Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/2.%20Peak%20Time%20Analysis.md): Peak commuting hours (6AM-9AM, 4PM-7PM) dominate travel, especially on weekdays like Wednesday, while Friday is the least busy. Rail operators could optimise staffing and resources during peak times and quieter periods for better efficiency.

   - [Route Popularity and Revenue Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/3.%20Route%20Popularity%20and%20Revenue%20Analysis.md): High-revenue routes like London to York drive profitability, while popular but low-revenue routes like Manchester to Liverpool require pricing adjustments. First-class tickets, though fewer in sales, contribute significantly to revenue.

   - [Customer Segment Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/4.%20Customer%20Segment%20Analysis.md): Advance Tickets drive the majority of revenue, despite lower prices than Anytime Tickets. Non-railcard passengers dominate revenue, suggesting opportunities to target them with promotions or encourage railcard adoption.

   - [Ticket Price and Journey Characteristics](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/5.%20Ticket%20Price%20and%20Journey%20Characteristics%20Analysis.md): Longer routes generally have higher ticket prices, but many routes are under or overpriced. Pricing strategies could be refined, especially for long-distance routes where prices deviate from expectations.

   - [Refunds and Delays Analysis](https://github.com/tomredfern24/Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Project-UK_Rail_Prices/blob/main/Report/6.%20Refunds%20and%20Delays%20Analysis.md): Over 25% of delayed or cancelled journeys lead to refund requests, with network issues being the primary cause. Shorter delays (16‚Äì30 minutes) result in the most refunds, and improving network infrastructure could reduce delays and related refunds.
