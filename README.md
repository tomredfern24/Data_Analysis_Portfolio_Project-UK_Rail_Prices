# MySQL-Power-BI-Data-Driven-Insights-Portfolio
This repository showcases my data analysis skills through a series of objectives utilizing MySQL and Power BI. The project employs a mock dataset of UK rail ticket sales from January to April 2024, offering insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills in data analysis using MySQL for querying and Power BI for data visualization. The project is based on a mock dataset of UK rail ticket sales from January to April 2024, which I analyzed to extract meaningful insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

The project is organized around a series of objectives that demonstrate my ability to:

- Write efficient SQL queries to extract and transform data.
- Create interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.
- Use data-driven insights to solve real-world business problems.

This project is part of my data analysis portfolio and is intended to highlight my proficiency in working with databases, conducting analyses, and presenting insights in an accessible format.

Feel free to explore the SQL queries, Power BI dashboards, and reports to see how I approach different analytical tasks, solve business questions and tell a story using data.

## Objectives


## Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI

## Project Structure
- `SQL_Queries/`: SQL queries for each objective.
- `PowerBI_Dashboards/`: Power BI `.pbix` files.
- `Visualizations/`: PNG files of key visualizations.
- `Report/`: Detailed analysis and conclusions for each objective.

## How to Explore
You can find the SQL queries in the `SQL_Queries/` folder and download the `.pbix` files from `PowerBI_Dashboards/` if you'd like to explore the dashboards interactively. Summarized visuals can be found in `Visualizations/`, and detailed explanations are provided in the `Report/` folder.
